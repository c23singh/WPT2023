# Wireless Power Transfer
### Research on WPT Side-channel Attacks and Exploit Mitigations of the Qi Wireless Charging Protocol

This research serves as an initial stage into the exploration of side-channel attacks and defensive mitigations for non-network, wireless, point-to-point communications systems

## Problem Statement
<ins>IDENTIFY</ins>

What vulnerabilities exist within systems via wireless power transfer; how can these vulnerabilities be exploited and defended against?

<ins>APPLY</ins>

The initial phase of this research includes the reproduction and expansion of research related to injection based hijacking of the charging process and non-intrusive eavesdropping of the charging process allowing for interpreted analysis of device activity.

<ins>EXPAND</ins>

This serves as the initial point of research to be provided to the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and help observe various other methods of similar side-channel attacks such as taking advantage of point-to-point communication capabilities.
