# Signature Analysis

### Signature Analysis Script:
This script will display the manufacturer, serial number, battery status, and power received of a device given a series of qi messages. These qi messages can currently only be obtained by hand copying them from the qi snifferâ€™s software to a text file. One good area to place effort would be automating the process of placing qi messages read by the sniffer into a text file. The  graph of the power received by the phone can be used to predict which applications are running on the device.
