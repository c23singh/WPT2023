## General Notes



### Qi Sniffer Software:
The Qi Sniffer and its software can be used in tandem to collect several important pieces of information from the communication between a device a the power transmitter. The Qi Sniffer must be placed in very close proximity to the transmitter. We tended to place the sniffer under the transmitter with the phone on top of everything. Once this is complete, the software can start recording by pressing the play button. To stop the recording, press the stop button. These snapshots can be saved as a .qid file. These files can only be opened by the sniffer software. The hex for these files can be explored using hexed.it, however, no useful information was found within. This may be worth exploring to automate the data collection process.
